# Systematic Developmental Toxicity Assessment of a Structurally Diverse Library of PFAS in Zebrafish

The data and results included here are a part of *insert citation to paper here* 

### Data & Analysis in brief: 

1. Experimental Design: The embryos were exposed to 10 concentrations of PFAS, 4 concentrations of PC (parathion ethyl positive control), and vehicle control. At 24 and 120    hpf, embryos were assessed for EPR, LPR, mortality and 10 morphological endpoints and a summary endpoint (ANY) for 139 PFAs from EPA library.
2. Censored morphology data using 'ANY_' endpoint for behavioral analysis and applied a 70% threshold during post-hoc QC (i.e., >70% fish must be healthy for that dose to be considered as behavioral hit)
3. Screened the library for bioactivity using Benchmark Dose as a metric (BMR 10).
4. Fisher exact test to test for associations between volatility status of chemical and bioactivity across endpoints
5. Chemotype enrichment analysis to test for associations between chemotype and bioactivity across endpoints
6. Correlation analysis between bioactivity and physiochemical properties.
