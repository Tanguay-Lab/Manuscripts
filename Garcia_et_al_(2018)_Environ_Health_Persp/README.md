## Abstract
#### **Background:**
A structurally diverse group of chemicals, including dioxins [e.g., 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-*p*-dioxin (TCDD)] and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), can xenobiotically activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and contribute to adverse health effects in humans and wildlife. In the zebrafish model, repression of *sox9b* has a causal role in several AHR-mediated toxic responses, including craniofacial cartilage malformations; however, the mechanism of *sox9b* repression remains unknown. We previously identified a long noncoding RNA, *sox9b* long intergenic noncoding RNA (*slincR*), which is increased (in an AHR-dependent manner) by multiple AHR ligands and is required for the AHR-activated repression of *sox9b*.

#### **Objective:**
Using the zebrafish model, we aimed to enhance our understanding of the signaling events downstream of AHR activation that contribute to toxic responses by identifying: *a*) whether *slincR* is enriched on the *sox9b* locus, *b*) *slincR*’s functional contributions to TCDD-induced toxicity, *c*) PAHs that increase *slincR* expression, and *d*) mammalian orthologs of *slincR*.

#### **Methods:**
We used capture hybridization analysis of RNA targets (CHART), qRT-PCR, RNA sequencing, morphometric analysis of cartilage structures, and hemorrhaging screens.

#### **Results:**
The *slincR* transcript was enriched at the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of the *sox9b* locus. Transcriptome profiling and human ortholog analyses identified processes related to skeletal and cartilage development unique to TCDD-exposed controls, and angiogenesis and vasculature development unique to TCDD-exposed zebrafish that were injected with a splice-blocking morpholino targeting *slincR*. In comparison to TCDD exposed control morphants, *slincR* morphants exposed to TCDD resulted in abnormal cartilage structures and a smaller percentage of animals displaying the hemorrhaging phenotype. In addition, *slincR* expression was significantly increased in six out of the sixteen PAHs we screened.

#### **Conclusion:**
Our study establishes that in zebrafish, *slincR* is recruited to the *sox9b* 5′ UTR to repress transcription, can regulate cartilage development, has a causal role in the TCDD-induced hemorrhaging phenotype, and is upregulated by multiple environmentally relevant PAHs. These findings have important implications for understanding the ligand-specific mechanisms of AHR-mediated toxicity. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP3281
