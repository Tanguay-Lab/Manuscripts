### [Supplemental Table 1](https://github.com/Tanguay-Lab/Manuscripts/blob/main/Shankar_2019_Int_J_Mol_Sci/Files/Supplemental_Table_1.xlsx)
* Table S1 - List of 123 PAHs, the lowest effect level (LEL) exposure concentrations for each endpoint measured, and the developmental toxicity bins of each PAH 
* Table S2 - List of DEGs (fold-change > 1.5, adjusted _p_-value < 0.05) for 14 of the 16 PAHs. 3-NF and 1,5- DMN had zero DEGs 
* Table S3 - Top 5000 genes by coefficient of variation (CV) across the 18 treatments (16 PAHs, 2 controls)
* Table S4 - Genes that are common to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 of the cluster B PAHs

### [Supplemental Table 2](https://github.com/Tanguay-Lab/Manuscripts/blob/main/Shankar_2019_Int_J_Mol_Sci/Files/Supplemental_Table_2.xlsx)
* Table S5: Significant functional pathways (_p_ < 0.05) associated with each of the 16 PAHs (one . Abbreviations: T - Number of genes in the term, Q – number of genes in the query list, Q&T – Number of genes in query list (Q) that are present in T, Q&T/Q – Union of Q and T as a fraction of Q, term ID – gene ontology term ID

### [Supplemental Figure 1](https://github.com/Tanguay-Lab/Manuscripts/blob/main/Shankar_2019_Int_J_Mol_Sci/Files/Supplemental_Figure_1.pdf)
* Figure S1: Concentration Uptake Ratio (CUR) for six PAHs compared to log KOW
